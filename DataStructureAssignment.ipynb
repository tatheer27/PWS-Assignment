How tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","- Tuples ensure data integrity in Python by being immutable. This immutability provides various key benefits:\n","\n","  - Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be altered. This means that the data remains constant throughout the program, preventing accidental modifications.\n","\n","  - Because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements of sets. This allows for the creation of more complex data structures while ensuring the data remains unchanged.\n","\n","  - Tuples are inherently thread-safe because they cannot be modified.

What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictonaries in Python?\n","- A hash table is a data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves data using key-value pairs.

This allows for quick access to the data.\n","- Relation to Dictionaries in Python:\n","  - Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.\n","\n","  - Keys are hashed to generate hash values, which determine where the corresponding values are stored in the dictionary.\n","\n","  - This allows for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions."],"metadata":{"id":"XqnwwTxb6ZS5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.

How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","- In Python, sets automatically handle duplicate values by ensuring that each element is unique.

Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","- Dictionaries were historically considered unordered because they didn't maintain any specific order for their key-value pairs.
